- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ebeneA
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building a solid foundation in coding from a beginners level. My tech experience comes in the form of basic computer skills, basic troubleshooting abilities, basic wifi and computer network setup, proficiency with productivity softwares such as Microsoft Office and Google Suite, social media engagement on several platforms, and smart phone savvy. With these skills, it is pretty obvious that I am a Gen Z. However, I want to expand my tech skills and jump into the world of coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript ES6 through the coding bootcamp SHECodes and building an interactive weather app as a project. In the meantime, I am look forward to seeing what other coders have done and are currently working on.
- HAPPY CODING Everyone!!!!!!!!
